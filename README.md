# Deez OS

This is a repository for storing all necessary components for runnning my own hobby operating system.

(this readme is really as bad as it gets, just straight to the point)

## Structure

```
- kernel (SaturnKernel)
- bootloader (Supernova)
- README.md
...
```

Currently there are 2 main components:
-   The kernel itself - `SaturnKernel`
-   The bootloader - `Supernova`

## Why?

Well, why not? I am trying to learn low-level programming and always wanted to create myself an OS, so this is perfect :D.
