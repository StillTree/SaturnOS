# Saturn OS

This is a repository (monorepo?) for storing all necessary components for runnning my own hobby operating system.

> Compiled and tested using x86_64-saturnos clang toolchain, other compilers will most definitely break.

## Custom toolchain

I use a completely custom OS-specific Clang toolchain. All of the instructions on correctly building all of its parts
can be found [here](ToolChain/README.md).

## Why?

Well, why not? I am trying to learn low-level programming and always wanted to create myself an OS, so this is perfect :D.
